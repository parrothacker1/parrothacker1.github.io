Hello Reader, I am parrothacker1 or parrot (ppl call me that) and I am a 20 year old cybersecurity enthusiast. 

But my enthusiasm just do not end with cybersec .. I am also into backend development and also DevOps. 

I primarily use my backend and devops knowledge in making CTFs questions and making people's life harder (but for enthusiasts who love challenges i believe mine give's them a new perspective).

I love to keep pushing boundaries and keep challenging myself whether it's cybersec or backend or devops

I used to be a ```Arch Linux``` user but now I have switched from it and now i am currently on ```NixOS```. The concept of declarative system seems new to me but it looks pretty cool! (Yeah .. that's the reason why I switched).

I know alot of stuff (not gonna list everything and make this boring) but I am capable of making a basic server in Python,Rust,Go and JS (these are my comfortable languages) and I am also well versed in Databases like Postgres,MariaDB,Mongo,Cassandra. Also I can handle some docker container stuff.

If you are interested in solving any CTF event or something like that with me .. hit me up on telegram or discord :)
